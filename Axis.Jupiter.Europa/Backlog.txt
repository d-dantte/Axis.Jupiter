3.1.0/features ===============================================================================================
-	Ability to configure Target and Storage Entities. Target entities are those coming from the domain side,
    StorageEntities are essentially the sqlserver optimized version of the domain entity; they typically
	contain things like foreign keys, primary keys, indexes, etc, that are not on the domain entity. [Done]
-	Add IEntityMapConfiguration.[Extract/Inject]StoreMetadata methods that allow the domain to cache/introduce
	Store metadata from/into the DataStore Context.
-	Europa now depends on Kore, and Kore.EF is now obsolete. [Done]
-	Expand the EFMapping implementation to accomodate Navigational properties and ComplexTypes [Done]
-	Expand the TableMapping of the EFMapping, as the old implementation was not robust [Done]
-	IPersistenceCommands.Add: acts only upon the object given to it, and not on its navigational properties.
	It forces ForeignKey scalars to be set, rather than relying on EF to act on all objects reachable via
	the object graph. 
-	IPersistenceCommands.DeleteBatch: gather all keys for all objects in the sequence, batch it by some number,
	and generate a delete command (per batch) where objects in the db match the keys in that batch. We may want
	to dump the keys to the delete records in a temp table so we can return it to the caller who can then use it
	to remove entities from the local context [Done].


3.2.0/features ================================================================================================
-	implement the bulk - delete, and bulk - update, using sql statements sent to the database containing 
    appropriate conditions. [Done]
